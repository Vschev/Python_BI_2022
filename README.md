This is an assortment of functions that work with the arrays containing int and float numbers in turn using built-in functions of the numpy package.
Numpy is required to make use of this tool.

THE LIST OF FUNCTIONS

matrix_multiplication(arg1, arg2)
multiplies the two arrays as matrices

multiplication_check(your_list)
checks if all the arrays in the input list can be consecutively multiplied
Returns True if yes, returns False otherwise.

multiply_matrices(your_list)
Same as above but either does the multiplication or returns None value if not possible.

compute_2d_distance(arg1, arg2)
Takes two 1d arrays as input and calculates the euclidian distance.

compute_multidimensional_distance(arg1, arg2)
Same as above.

compute_pair_distances(ar)
Takes the 2d array as an input and creates a matrix of pairwise distances for all the rows in it.
